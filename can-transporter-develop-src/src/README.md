This folder contains the can-transporter node in our 2023-2024 UTS Rover, taken directly from our previous Gitlab repository. Built by our software team including myself. The code that I contibuted was the following:
canbus/ActuatorCanBusController.cpp
canbus/ActuatorCanBusController.h
drive_motor/ActuatorMessageBuilder.cpp
drive_motor/ActuatorMessageBuilder.h

The primary goal of the this can-transporter repository is to handle all messages to the drive motors and the actuator motors on the CAN bus.
