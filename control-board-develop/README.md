This folder contains the actuator control code in our 2023-2024 UTS Rover, taken directly from our previous Gitlab repository. Built by myself. The code that I contibuted was the following:
ControlBoard.ino

This code is designed to handle the CAN messages and convert the data suitable for our actuator motors.
