# UTS-Rover-Team-Contributions

During my time in the UTS Rover Team (2021 - 2024) I contributed to the following repositories located on our private Gitlab page. It shows my experience working with embedded systems where I primarily worked with the CANBus and Serial communication protocol through ROS (Robot Operating System). This code was deployed onto the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier computer and was capable of interfacing with 12V drive motors as well as 12V actuator motors (which I was mainly involved with). 

The codebase for the UTS Rover Team is quite extensive, and this repository only shows my personal contributions to their system. I have tried my best to remain honest in the README files and only highlight the work I did, not my team members.
